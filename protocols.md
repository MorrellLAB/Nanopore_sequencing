# RAPID kit
Please see the record in my note book.

This kit usually can get 2.3-2.9 Gbases data for barley samples (I tested wild barley and elite barley).

**Warning**!! Please turn off the basecall during sequencing, otherwise, it will make the living base call very slow.

After the finish loading sample, remember to type "caffeinate", which will keep you compute aweak and make sure the sequencing will run smoothly.

FFPE DNA repair is not usefull to improve the data volumn for RAPID kit.
